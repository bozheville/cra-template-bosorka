# Bosorka

a personal template for [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## The reason to appear

The goal is to have a template with a quick start, that allows bootstraping a project and starting a feature-develppment instead of setting up an environment. It was annoying to do the same steps one-by-one after creating a new project.

## Key features

- Pre-installed [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui). Lightweight design system with a components library that has a wonderful [a11y](https://a11yproject.com/) support and allows styling with a support of 4 breakpoints
- Typescript
- Testing environment of jest/enzyme
- Custom hook for syncing with the URL
- i18next for text organizing
